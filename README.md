## Description

![main screenshot](./public/assets/images/screen1.png)

This project is a react-only version of my portfolio. My non-React portfolio (built using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript) can be found here:

https://rrich-kray.github.io/project-portfolio/

I consider this an MVP build, and plan to add several new features in the near future, including Modals that appear when a project is selected. These will provide additional project information, including a description and additional screenshots.

## How it Works

The application was built using React, and consists of five components, including:

- About
- Contact
- Footer
- Hero
- Projects
- Resume

The Footer and Hero sections are displayed on all pages. The header, shown below,

![main screenshot](./public/assets/images/screen1.png)

contains links that, when selected, call function closers that change a state within the parent component, which in turn renders a different component of the website.

For example, selecting the "About" link within the navigation bar will render the following page:

Similiarly, selecting the "Contact" link will render the Contact section:
